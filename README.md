# NN_DT

NN and DT models for y=x^2 case in "Neural Networks are Decision Trees" paper

From y_x2_reproduce.py file, one can reach the saved NN model that approximates y=x^2 function and the equivalent tree written manually for reporoduction purposes.
The code plots results for both NN and tree and shows their equivalance via printing maximum squared error between predictions of both.
